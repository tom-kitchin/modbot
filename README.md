## Modbot

A simple bot used by the Cool Ghosts discord community for moderation tools.
Uses the [gemstone](https://github.com/z64/gemstone.git) discord bot template.


## Configuring and running your bot

Make a copy of [config-template.yaml](https://github.com/z64/gemstone/blob/master/data/config-template.yaml) and rename it to `config.yaml` *exactly*.

Fill out each field provided to set up a minimal discord bot, with a few commands and an event to get you started.

To run your bot, open your terminal and run `ruby run.rb` in the top level folder of your bot.
