  Mention (@modbot) or PM me commands to use.
  Supported commands:
  - `!help` - show this message
  - `!new` - show the introduction message for new members
  - `!rules` - show the server rules
  Any other messages PM'd to modbot are passed on to the moderators (NOT anonymously) as a tool for reporting and/or seeking help.

  I also handle roles for finding fellow Ghosts to play with! The following commands only work in the server, not in PMs.
  Supported commands:
  - `!listroles` - display a list of available roles
  - `!getrole <rolename>` - claim the named role
  - `!droprole <rolename>` - remove a role you don't want any more
